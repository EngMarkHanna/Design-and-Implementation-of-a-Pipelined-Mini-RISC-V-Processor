# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Pipelined-Mini-RISC-V-Processor

The **Design and Implementation of a Pipelined Mini RISC-V Processor** focuses on developing a mini RISC-V processor with pipelining, hazard detection, and data forwarding. The project involved designing and optimizing key components, including the **ALU, Immediate Generation Unit, Register File, Control Unit, Hazard Detection Unit, Forwarding Unit, and ALU Control Unit**, ensuring efficient execution of instructions while minimizing logic usage. A **control unit** was implemented to generate pipeline flags based on instruction types, improving execution efficiency. The processor was rigorously tested through simulation by loading and executing RISC-V assembly programs, verifying proper functionality, pipelining efficiency, and correct execution of all supported instructions.
